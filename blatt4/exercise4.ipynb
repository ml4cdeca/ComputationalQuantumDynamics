This model features a quantum phase transition at $\\Omega/J=1$, meaning that the ground state propoerties change abruptly. It also shows a dynamical phase transition at $\\Omega/J=0.5$, meaning that the long time properties of the dynamics change drastically at this point. The dynamical case was recently studied experimentally using a chain of trapped ions (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24654). Note the different convention (x<>z) and the differences in the definition of field and interaction strength chosen there. Also, in the experiment the interactions where not strictly infinite range but powerlaw with a small exponent.\n",

    "Loop over $\\Omega$ (from 0 to 2 in small steps) and record the lowest 3 eigenenergies and, for the ground state, the probabilities P(M) to be in state $|N/2,M\\rangle$. Plot the 3 lowest energy levels and P(M;$\\Omega$) (density plot!). At small $\\Omega$ you should observe kind of a \"spontaneous symmetry breaking\": The gap between ground and first excited state becomes very small. The states $|00...0\\rangle = |N/2,N/2\\rangle$ and $|11...1\\rangle = |N/2,-N/2\\rangle$ are degenerate ground states at a $\\Omega=0$. The Hamiltonian has a $Z_2$ symmetry. It is invariant under flipping of all spins. Thus the eigenstates should also respect this symmetry and be either symmetric or anti-symmetric with respect to spin flips. However, when the gap between the symmetric and anti-symmetric state becomes too small, the numerical diagonalization algorithm just randomly choses a superposition of the two states, which can as well be $|N/2,-N/2\\rangle$ or $|N/2,N/2\\rangle$, thus breaking the symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spin flip symmetry means that, if written in the symmetrized basis, the Hamiltonian will consist of two disconnected blocks, representing the symmetric ($\\propto |N/2,M\\rangle + |N/2,-M\\rangle$) and anti-symmetric states ($\\propto |N/2,M\\rangle - |N/2,-M\\rangle$). This means that the relevant gap we have to look at is the gap between lowest two states of one block. If we don't want to do the symmetrization explicitly, this can be done by just looking at the energy difference between the ground and the second excited state, which should be both symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Optional]: One could also fix this by considering the symmetric and anti-symmetric blocks separately. For this you need to implement the Hamiltonian again in the symmetrized basis (or use a basis transformation into the symmetrized basis). This will give a speedup of at least a factor of 2."

Extract the position and size of the smallest gap as a function of N. Loop N from 40 to 400 in steps of 20. The easiest way to get the minimal gap is to calculate it on an omega-gid around 1, where the transition is expected to be. I increased $\\Omega$ from 0.8 to 1 in 100 steps. You could also make the search for the minimal gap more efficient by implementing an iterative search procedure.\n",

For this, you could use scipy's expm function which allows you to simply exponentiate a matrix so you can directly calculate $exp(-iHt)$ and apply it to the initial state (e.g. using the @ operator). Try this out. You will see that it becomes really slow as you go to larger atom numbers. The more efficient way is to use exact diagonalization. This time the use of sparse matrices is not crucial since we need all the eigenstates anyway. Also, the spin flip symmetry is now not so useful since our initial state already breaks this symmetry. \n",
