    "### Exercise 1: Solving the AKLT model with exact diagonalization (25 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "This time we want to study a quantum many-body model for spins known as the AKLT model which was introduced in the 80's to explore the Haldane conjecture(see https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.799). It has a couple of remarkable features that will allow us to use it as playground for testing the basic ideas surrounding matrix product states. As additional practice on how to build general spin models and exact diagonalization, we will start by solving it here by numerical means and then compare the result to some theoretical predictions. You can use some of the code from the last exercise as a basis but make sure to modify the operators as now we are working with spin 1!  \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, this is a spin 1 model and it lives in a one dimensional chain with periodic boundary conditions (using the correct boundary condition is critical here) and the Hamiltonian is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H=J\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{3} +\\frac{1}{2}S^{(i)}\\cdot S^{(i+1)}+\\frac{1}{6}(S^{(i)}\\cdot S^{(i+1)})^2\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Remenber that, due to the periodic boundary conditions, the Nth spin is identified with 0th spin. $S^{(i)}$ denotes the vector of spin sperators $(S_x^{(i)}, S_y^{(i)}, S_z^{(i)})$. It might be convenient to use the following representation for the spin their products:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S^{(i)}\\cdot S^{(i+1)} = S_z^{(i)} S_z^{(i+1)}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(S_+^{(i)}S_-^{(i+1)}+S_-^{(i)}S_+^{(i+1)}\\right)\n",

    "\n",
    "Build the Hamiltonian in the standard product basis ($J$ is just a global energy scale and can be set to 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "First you can test your implementation by calculating the ground state energy and making sure it is zero as this is the theoretical prediction. Another test is the magnetization on the z direction which should also be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are confident that your code is working you should compute the energy gap between ground and first excited state for a couple of system sizes $N$ and see how it behaves. Is the system gapped? This question is directly related to the Haldane conjecture.\n",

    "Study what happens to the gap of the system as you change $\\theta$, moving away from $\\theta_0$, and interpret your results. After this you should look at the entanglement of the ground state for different $\\theta$ taking into account your conclusions about the gap. What happens to the entanglement entropy and the schmidt rank as $\\theta$ changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: a nice trick to compute partial traces is to use the function reshape() as it allows you to rewrite your state as a matrix in the way required for a Schmidt decomposition. After that all you need to do to get the entanglement spectrum is perform a svd (also available in the usual places) and look at the singular values."
